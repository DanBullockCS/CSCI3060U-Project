# CSCI3060U_Backend (CSCI3060U Project Phase 4-6, Team noLabToday)

# Phase 4 - How to run:

- To compile the program use the make command to run the makefile like so:
```
make
```
- Then change directory back to the main directory (CSCI3060U_Backend) with the command:
```
cd ..
```
- The reason for this is because we are using a package to connect all the classes called "noLabToday"
- Then run the compiled program using:
```
java noLabToday.Main
```
